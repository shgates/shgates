# About Me

I'm a fullstack software engineer pursuing my computer science degree. 
I like to build backend, distributed systems and low level stuff, mostly with Go, NodeJS, Python and C/C++ (i plan to learn Rust in the future). 
I'm open to contribute to open-source projects in these fields so if you have a cool project, contact me :D
